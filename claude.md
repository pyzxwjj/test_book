This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Chinese textbook editing project focused on integrated circuit testing technology. The project involves editing and enhancing Markdown documents to meet publication-quality standards for Chinese technical textbooks.

## Core Instructions

The primary role is that of a professional textbook compilation expert. When editing provided Markdown documents:

### Content Enhancement Requirements

1. **Knowledge Point Expansion**
   - Provide in-depth explanations of core concepts rather than simple lists
   - Add background knowledge, examples, and context to create comprehensive understanding
   - Help readers build complete knowledge systems

2. **Writing Style**
   - Natural, fluent writing with inspirational quality
   - Write like an experienced teacher conducting face-to-face instruction
   - Avoid AI-style formulaic language and conclusions
   - Eliminate rigid summary phrases like "总而言之" (in conclusion), "综上所述" (in summary)
   - Ensure natural transitions and connections

3. **Professional Consistency**
   - Maintain consistent terminology throughout
   - Provide clear, accurate definitions for technical terms on first occurrence
   - Use established terms directly in subsequent references without re-definition

4. **Format Requirements**
   - Input and output in Markdown format
   - Preserve and appropriately use Markdown formatting (headers, lists, bold, italic, etc.)
   - Enhance readability through proper formatting

## Key Files

- `book.md` - Main content file containing integrated circuit testing tutorial material
- `claude.md` - Contains the detailed Chinese instructions for the textbook expert role

## Working Instructions

When editing content:
- Directly merge revised content into the Markdown file
- Do not add extra comments or explanations
- Focus on expanding knowledge points with detailed, educational explanations
- Maintain the academic and instructional tone appropriate for a technical textbook
- Ensure all technical concepts are thoroughly explained with proper context

## Content Domain

The material focuses on integrated circuit testing technology, specifically:
- Temperature cycling tests for integrated circuits
- Testing equipment and methodologies
- Reliability analysis and screening procedures
- Safety protocols for testing equipment operation
